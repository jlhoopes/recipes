The Best Crockpot Chicken Noodle Soup

Ingredients:

1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 cups carrots, peeled and chopped
1 medium yellow onion, diced
3 stalks celery, chopped
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
3 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 bay leaf
6 cups chicken broth (use my EASY homemade broth or low-sodium)
1 cup water
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste (~ 1/2 teaspoon salt & 1/4 teaspoon pepper)
2 cups uncooked wide egg noodles
3 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
 
 
Directions:

1. In a 6 quart crockpot place whole chicken breasts on the bottom and top with , carrots, onion, celery, garlic, olive oil, thyme and bay leaf.

2. Next add in chicken broth, water, and season with salt and pepper to taste. I used 1/2 teaspoon salt & 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Cover and cook on low heat 6 â€“ 7 hours.

3. Remove cooked chicken breasts and cut into bite sized pieces. Place chicken back in to the crockpot. Now add in egg noodles and parsley.
Increase temperature to high, cover and cook 10-15 minutes longer, until noodles are tender.
